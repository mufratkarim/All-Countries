# Activities 

1. Utilized REST based web-service with Retrofit and other libraries to display the information of 195 countries.
2. Retrieved the JSON data from back end through HTTP requests and used Gson to convert them as Java Objects. 
3. Executed asynchronous calls with RxJava to return the result in UI thread without crashing the program. 
4. Injected dependencies with the Dependency Injection, Dagger2 to delegate the creation of Retrofit and Singleton objects in a separate framework, which allowed a clear path for Unit testing with Junit and Mockito.
