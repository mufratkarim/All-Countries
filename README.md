# Activities 
•	Utilized REST based web-service with Retrofit and other libraries to display the information of 195 countries.
•	Retrieved the JSON data from back end through HTTP requests and used Gson to convert them as Java Objects. 
•	Executed asynchronous calls with RxJava to return the result in UI thread without crashing the program. 
•	Injected dependencies with the Dependency Injection, Dagger2 to delegate the creation of Retrofit and Singleton objects in a separate framework, which allowed a clear path for Unit testing with Junit and Mockito.
